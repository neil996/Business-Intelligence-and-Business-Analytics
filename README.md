* Olist Store is a very large departmental store in Brazil and it connects various small stores across the country on a single platform without any issues. As many stores are in the rural areas which though having products are not able to sell across the country due to logistic issues and most important factor to outreach the large consumer base. Through integration with Olist marketplace, such small and medium level stores are given the opportunity to expand their consumer base across regions which were earlier not part of their manifesto.
* The marketplace under which Olist operates comes under E-commerce, which has seen a rapid increase in the consumer base. In Latin â€“America, Brazil has a strong place in the e-commerce market with a market share closing to around 43%. As many rural areas in Brazil are able to access things outside their regions via mobile phones, thus attracting a large consumer base, and with a market share approaching 50 percent share in the entire Latin America, Brazil as a country cannot be ignored as a prospective marketplace considering the large population and ownership of cashless payment facilities mainly through credit cards. Moreover the increasing mobile commerce across the country with a significant percentage of approximately 40 percent just next to United States of America, makes Brazil as the forerunner in the prospect of E-commerce business.
* The operations or processes involved in E-commerce from Olist perspective is that a seller has to fill a form so that we can tag them as our potential Leads who wants to expand their business with our firm. Once they fill their information our sales executives would get in touch with the prospective seller and will the close the deal meaning the seller would sigh up and then we would give access to the seller to list their products on Olist
